# EARS Specifications

This directory contains requirements written using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) style. EARS provides a simple, structured way to express requirements using patterns such as Ubiquitous, Event-Driven, State-Driven, Unwanted Behavior, and Optional features.

Organize specs by product or component. Include traceability links to PRDs and tests where possible.
