# Plans Directory

This directory is for project planning documents. Plans are created to outline the work required to complete a feature or a set of tasks.

## The Role of Plans

Plans are used to:

- Define the scope of work.
- Break down work into smaller, manageable tasks.
- Estimate the effort required for each task.
- Identify dependencies between tasks.
- Define success criteria and acceptance tests.

### Examples

- Small feature plan: `plans/examples/plan-small.md`

## The Role of TODO items

`plans/TODO.md` is the single source of truth for the agent's work queue. It is a markdown checklist of tasks that the agent needs to complete.

## Archive

Completed plans are moved from this directory into the `plans/archive` directory.
