# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs document significant architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They create a durable record that helps future maintainers understand why choices were made.

## ADR approval process

**Mission Critical** All ADRs must be created in a branch and submitted for review, before being merged to the main branch.

## Index

Add links to ADRs in sequential order using the naming convention `adr-NNNN-title-slug.md`.
