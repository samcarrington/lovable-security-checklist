# Frontend Instructions

<CRITICAL_REQUIREMENT type="MANDATORY">

- Use TypeScript for new code and interfaces for component props.
- Enforce accessibility: semantic HTML first; ARIA complements, not substitutes.
- Include tests for new components and changed logic (render + key behavior).
  </CRITICAL_REQUIREMENT>

<!--
SECTION PURPOSE: Universal rules for all frontend code.
PROMPTING: Imperative checklist for quick verification.
-->

## General Guidelines

1. **Code Structure**: Prefer small, reusable components and feature modules.
2. **Follow Best Practices**: Adhere to SOLID principles, DRY, and KISS. Adhere to Nuxt conventions, guidelines and standards.
3. **Styling**: Follow repo standard (CSS Modules/Tailwind/SCSS). Avoid inline styles except small dynamic cases.
4. **Accessibility**: Prefer native controls, clear labels, visible focus, sufficient contrast.
5. **Testing**: Use the project's testing stack (e.g., Jest + Testing Library). See the Testing section below.

<!--
SECTION PURPOSE: Expectations when authoring components.
PROMPTING: Specify contract (props/state), error modes, and data flow norms.
-->

## Component Development

1. **Props**: Define with TypeScript; document optional vs required. Provide sensible defaults.
2. **State Management**: Prefer local state; lift to Context/Redux only when shared or cross-cutting.
3. **API Calls**: Use the shared API client; centralize endpoints and schemas; handle errors explicitly.
4. **Error Boundaries**: Add boundaries around risky trees; fail gracefully.

<!--
SECTION PURPOSE: Make testing guidance explicit and link to SSOTs (Tester chat mode and BDD instructions).
PROMPTING: Reference, don't duplicate. Keep actions concrete for frontend.
-->

## Testing

1. **SSOT References**

   - Tester chat mode: `.github/chatmodes/Tester.chatmode.md`
   - BDD tests instructions: `.github/instructions/bdd-tests.instructions.md`

2. **Unit/UI Tests (default stack: Jest + Testing Library unless overridden)**

   - Cover rendering, critical interactions (click, type, submit), and state transitions.
   - Include accessibility assertions (roles/labels/name, focus management, keyboard nav).
   - Assert async states: loading, success, and error paths; handle empty data gracefully.

3. **E2E/UI Flows (optional, if project uses Playwright/Cypress)**

   - Keep scenarios small and stable; tag appropriately (e.g., `@ui`, `@smoke`).
   - Prefer testids sparingly; select by role/name first.

4. **Coverage Policy**
   - Follow central Quality & Coverage Policy in `.github/copilot-instructions.md#quality-policy`.
   - Ensure hot paths and error paths are fully covered (100%).

<!--
SECTION PURPOSE: Keep apps fast and responsive.
PROMPTING: Short, actionable techniques.
-->

## Performance Optimization

1. **Lazy Loading**: Defer large routes and heavy components.
2. **Memoization**: Use React.memo/useMemo/useCallback to avoid unnecessary work.
3. **Code Splitting**: Split at route and major component boundaries.
4. **Minimize Re-renders**: Keep props stable; use selectors and derived memoized data.

<!--
SECTION PURPOSE: Enforce baseline quality gates.
PROMPTING: XML block for machine-checkable rules.
-->

<PROCESS_REQUIREMENTS type="MANDATORY">

- Run lints and tests locally before PR.
- Include accessibility checks (labels, keyboard nav, focus order) in reviews.
- Avoid `any`; if unavoidable, annotate with a TODO and reason.
  </PROCESS_REQUIREMENTS>
